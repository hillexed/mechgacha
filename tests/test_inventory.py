- Artificial Satellite ★★★ - A small artificial space structure (a satellite, space ship, etc) orbits your mech.
-# **     **`[4]` • COSMETIC
- WEIRD LIL' GUY ★★★ - A bizarre, chimeric creature akin to an illumination has begun following you around. Its presence seems to spur your mech forwards, increasing its speed and giving it a short forward charge. Plus, it's cute.
-# **     **`[5]` • COSMETIC
- ROTBORN STOMPER ★★ - Sturdy weatherproofed legs. Slow and steady, but surprisingly agile. Capable of performing short leaps and dashes to clear obstacles or close the distance. Slightly reduces the effects of debuffs.
-# **     **`[6]` • LEGS
- Hook Lash ★★ - A whip with a spinning metal weight at the end that applies a random debuff on hit
-# **     **`[7]` • WEAPON
