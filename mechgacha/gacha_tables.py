    CockpitItem("theoddman:crest_factory_new","Crest Factory New","Equipped with a direct neural link, the cockpit is cushioned but otherwise spartan. Sometimes you hear a mercenary on comms exclaim that they don't want to be babysitting some new guy. You don't see them anywhere and you're probably doing a lot more than them anyway.",stars=1),

    WeaponItem("theoddman:wpu_lamia","KWG-ORBIT","A weapon that uses gravity and powerful electromagnets to accelerate it's projectiles in a circular chamber before firing out the front. Wants good mounts to keep steady. You can set it up to fire a wide variety of things.",stars=3),

    WeaponItem("theoddman:as_gz03","AS-GZ03","An energy shield that uses an artificial gravity field to enhance protection, and houses two laser sword emitters on its end. It looks really cool, but has a high energy drain.",stars=1),

    BodyItem("chillychilichelle:stripped_framework","Stripped Framework","The bare skeleton of a long-defunct mech. Composed of hollow steel tubes and dangling wires. Originally the leftovers from a salvage, it reaches only the barest minimum of what is considered a mech.",stars=2),
    CockpitItem("chillychilichelle:black_box","Black Box","A large steel cube, wrapped in a dozen layers of insulation and armor. Lacks any way to directly view the outside world. Contains up to 2 months of food, water, and oxygen. Requires the pilot to be hermetically sealed in each mission.",stars=2),
