    LegsItem("n217:the_chariot","ARC007//The Chariot","ARC007 is composed of two interrelated parts: a series of thin legs on the outside, trading resilience for high speed; and some dozen copies inside, that will be released and attached to the mech whenever any outer legs are damaged beyond use. Designed for constant motion, heedless of harm.",stars=3),
    KitItem("n217:strength","ARC008//Strength","A team of between 4 and 6 skilled rodent technicians, machinists, and necromancers for hire. They tend to drive a hard bargain, but they are frighteningly effective in return—willing to work themselves to death (and back out of it) to keep all systems online. Just make sure your mech is fireproof.",stars=3),
    PowerItem("n217:the_hermit","ARC009//The Hermit","A power cell of improbable energy density—just one the size of a fist is enough to last days. However, ARC009 is also highly unstable, needing to be placed in a sealed chamber and constantly supervised for any potential signs of disaster. At least the warm iridescent glow around it looks nice.",stars=4),
    ArmsItem("n217:wheel_of_fortune","ARC010//Wheel of Fortune","Drones in the shape of hands. These can be used as normal arms and range extenders, or they can be set to operate autonomously—seeking out, interfering with, and countering any enemy offenses without pilot input…as long as you trust the highly unpredictable, two-decade-out-of-date AI to do its job.",["weapon"],stars=2),
    BackItem("n217:justice","ARC011//Justice","A massive fish tank, attached to a mech's back. The water within ARC011 is perpetually murky, only allowing the briefest of glimpses at its inside—at the shadow of a cetacean eye, whose gaze seems to tear at one's guilt and regret down to the bone. A protection against backstabs and sneak attacks.",stars=4),
    ArmsItem("n217:the_hanged_man","ARC012//The Hanged Man","Lightly-rusted mechanical arms, made from interlocking copper plates and gears. A technology inherited from A.R.C.’s predecessor grants ARC012 the ability to “steal time” with every direct melee attack—slowing down an opponent a few seconds at a time, whilst speeding the mech in return.",["weapon"],stars=3),
    BodyPlanItem("n217:death","ARC013//Death","Any mech part can draw blood, or feed an engine. Any hollow space can house a pilot. Torn off limbs can be replaced with those still intact, and plating around thrusters can fill gaps in armour. ARC013 is a shapeless blueprint, made to accommodate adaptation—even in the midst of combat",{"legs":2,"arms":2},stars=4),
    KitItem("n217:temperance","ARC014//Temperance","A network of tunnels within a mech, which seems to magnify the cacophony of battle and attract Unbirds. ARC014 grants a mech the ability to submerge into the ground, much like the unvians within it—with the maximum duration spent underground increasing with greater quantities of Unbirds.",stars=3),
    BodyPlanItem("n217:the_devil","ARC015//The Devil","Blades in the back, shots in the dark. ARC015 can muffle sound, hide heat signatures, and is capable of carrying upwards of 2 extra weapons—at the cost of automatically retracting and disabling all weapons when directly illuminated and observed. Keep out of sight, and keep the lights shut.",{"legs":2,"arms":2,"weapons":4},stars=3),
    WeaponItem("n217:the_tower","ARC016//The Tower","A simple throwing spear that can be remotely detonated.

    CosmeticItem("n217:the_star","ARC017//The Star","A purely decorative constellation of lamps, too weak to properly illuminate beyond a mere few steps forward. Yet, something in your heart tells you that if you are ever lost, ever stranded, ever too far from your mech, those lights will guide you back to the cockpit—to where you belong.",stars=2),
    CosmeticItem("n217:the_moon","ARC018//The Moon","A coat of glimmering, ashy paint. ARC017 can, in theory, work as a genuine source of illumination—releasing a light which intensifies the closer the mech is to the nearest moon, to potentially blinding luminosity. However, due to the location of most mech arenas, it often only manages a dim glow.",stars=3),
    CosmeticItem("n217:the_sun","ARC019//The Sun","Days before the historic 27-day A.R.C. strike, an engineer saved a defunct Mech AI from being scrapped. It ended up playing such a key role in broadcasting the strike that, after the strike's victory, it was preserved and spread across A.R.C.—eventually becoming ARC019, your cheerful, sunny friend.",stars=3),
    CockpitItem("n217:judgement","ARC020//Judgement","A copper bird with gemstone eyes, a gift from A.R.C., whistles. Outside, traps open early, and the killzone timer beeps late, and opponent mechs are swallowed in quicksand. Your opponent is struggling against these sudden obstacles, but it’s futile. The results—the bird whispers—are already fixed.",stars=5),
    LegsItem("n217:the_world","ARC021//The World","Once, an ARC140 was inscribed with strange runes found on a pair of abnormally sturdy trekking boots. ARC021 is the result: mech legs which cannot break, fail, or kneel, and which can teleport to “anywhere graced by ingenuity, curiosity, or exploration”—carrying the will to chart the world onwards.",stars=5),
